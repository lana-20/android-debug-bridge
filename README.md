# [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) Utility


Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets me communicate with a device. The <code>adb</code> command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps. <code>adb</code> provides access to a Unix shell that I can use to run a variety of commands on a device. It is a client-server program that includes three components:

* A **client**, which sends commands. The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a command-line terminal by issuing an adb command.
* A **daemon (adbd)**, which runs commands on a device. The daemon runs as a background process on each device.
* A **server**, which manages communication between the client and the daemon. The server runs as a background process on your development machine.

<code>adb</code> is included in the Android SDK Platform Tools package.
